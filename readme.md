The BitMaxx NFT Collection, built on the MaxxChain network, offers a unique digital asset experience. This GitHub README provides a detailed explanation of the Admin tab in the collection's interface. The Admin tab is designed for collection administrators to manage various aspects of the NFT collection, such as revealing the collection, pausing minting, setting prices, withdrawing funds, and distributing rewards.

## Features

### 1. Reveal Collection
